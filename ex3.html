      <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>.[11] Over 97% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.
      <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
